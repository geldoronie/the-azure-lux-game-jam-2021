# Lords of Automata

## Objective

The objective of the game is to create a prosperous kingdom. To do that, you have to manage your resources and most important your people. If you lose all your people is game over!

## Vikings Raid

Each turn that passes a Viking Raid is coming close to happen, to defend against the Vikings you must create an military army with the same amount of vikings that are coming to raid you. If you do not manage to mach the Vikings army you will lose 2 People for each Viking that remains after combating with your army.

For instance, if there are 35 Vikings coming to raid you and you only have 30 Military the Vikings will kill all your military and another 10 People from your kingdom.

The game will only consider a game over after your turn end and you have less than 1 People remaining, so use your cards wisely!

## Progression

Each end your your turn your progression will be measure using these values:

| Resource | Points |
| -------- | ------ |
| Food     | 1      |
| Gold     | 1.5    |
| Military | 2      |
| People   | 3      |
| Stone    | 1      |
| Wood     | 1      |

## Cards

### Buildings

Each building will provide resources per turn, but it can also cost some resources, so be careful of each building you are placing.
